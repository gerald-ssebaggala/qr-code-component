### What I learned
I use this section to highlight my major learnings while working through this short project since this will be a great way to reinforce my own knowledge.

```html
  <div class="container">
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" class="qr-code-img">
    <h4 class="intro">
      Improve your front-end skills by building projects
    </h4>
    <p class="sub__intro">
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
    </p>
  </div>
```

```css

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');

```

If I want more help with writing markdown, I just check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development
Wanna give it a shot again using frontend frameworks.

### Useful resources

[FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) - to take the screenshot.

 google Fonts: (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - I have the link already imported in the styles sheet, just that have commented out the Outfit font-family since with windows browser wasn't looking great. Though feel free to un-comment it out if it looks great on yours.
